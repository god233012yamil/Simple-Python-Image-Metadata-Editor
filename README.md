Image Metadata Editor: A PyQt5 and PIL-based Application

This Python application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to read, display, 
and edit metadata embedded in digital images. Built with PyQt5, it offers tools for 
opening image files, viewing their EXIF metadata, and modifying it directly within 
the app. Users can select specific metadata tags via a dropdown menu, edit their values, 
and save the modified image with updated metadata. This project leverages the PIL (Pillow) 
library to handle image operations and piexif for detailed EXIF data manipulation, 
making it an ideal tool for photographers, digital artists, and developers needing to 
manage image metadata efficiently.
